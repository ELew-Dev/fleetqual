# Dev Log — May 21, 2025

## Daily Notes

## What I worked on:

* Set up the folder & file structure for `fleetqual`
* Initialized `README.md` with project overview, structure, and setup instructions
* Created initial version of `scan.py` module for gathering system information
* Started keeping detailed dev notes to track understanding and progress

As I go through this it isn’t my expectation to know how to code everything needed but to learn and problem solve. If anything I will learn how each file and code connects and that will help me understand why I’m writing what I’m writing.

So I started with the `scan.py` code. Although I understand the basics of coding I don’t know where to start with things like this, so I have used other resources to help me code. Working through this line by line, this is how `scan.py` works:

1. **Importing `psutil`**: It will get the system info that is needed such as CPU, memory, disk usage, etc. With this package I won’t have to manually read systems or call OS commands.
2. **`def get_cpu_info():`** defines a function so we can reuse this block of code.
3. `cpu_count = psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)` — this is teaching me about hardware. It calls to get the physical core count, which is something the CPU physically has.
4. `cpu_freq = psutil.cpu_freq()` — useful to know the max CPU speed the system can hit.
5. `return { ... }` — Returns a dictionary (key-value pairs) with two keys: `"cores"`: the physical core count, and `"max_frequency_mhz"`: the max CPU frequency in MHz. Returning structured data makes it easy to use downstream — like validation or reporting. Note: `cpu_freq.max if cpu_freq else None` protects against cases where frequency info is unavailable.
6. **`def get_ram_info():`** — this is the same idea as CPU but for RAM info.
7. `ram = psutil.virtual_memory()` — gets system memory stats, like total and available RAM in bytes.
8. The line `return { ... }` is used to return a dictionary containing RAM information. In this context, the function is gathering memory data—such as total, used, and free RAM—originally measured in bytes. Since bytes are very small units, the values are converted to gigabytes (GB) by dividing by 1024 to the power of 3 (which equals 1,073,741,824 bytes in a gigabyte). This conversion makes the information more readable and relevant for typical system monitoring. After the conversion, each value is rounded to two decimal places to present a clean, user-friendly output. The resulting dictionary might look like `{ "total": 16.0, "used": 8.5, "free": 7.5 }`, making it easy to understand the system’s memory usage at a glance.
9. `if __name__ == "__main__":` — This is a way of saying only run the following code if this file is executed directly.
10. `print("CPU Info:", get_cpu_info())` — calls the CPU info function and prints the dictionary nicely labeled.
11. `print("RAM Info:", get_ram_info())` — same for RAM info.

## Questions I have:

* How deep does `psutil` go on firmware-level data?
* Can we reliably extract BIOS/UEFI versions this way, or do we need another tool?

## Next steps:

* Start writing `validate.py` to check system info against expected YAML-based rules
* Handle edge cases where system info is incomplete or missing
* Explore adding disk or firmware info collection logic
* Continue documenting everything clearly in `notes/` to track learning and rationale
