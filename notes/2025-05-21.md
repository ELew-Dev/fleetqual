# Dev Log — May 21, 2025

## What I worked on:

* Set up folder & file structure for `fleetqual`
* Initialized `README.md` with project overview, structure, and setup instructions
* Started implementing `scan.py` module for gathering system info

## Reflections:

As I go through this it isn’t my expectation to know how to code everything needed but to learn and problem solve. If anything, I will learn how each file and code connects and that will help me understand why I’m writing what I’m writing.

## Breakdown of `scan.py` Code:

1. **Importing psutil**: This package helps collect system info (CPU, memory, disk usage, etc.) without needing manual system calls or OS commands.

2. **Function `def get_cpu_info():`**

   * Defines a reusable function to get CPU data.
   * `cpu_count = psutil.cpu_count(logical=False)`: gets physical core count.
   * `cpu_freq = psutil.cpu_freq()`: gets the max frequency.
   * Returns a dictionary with `"cores"` and `"max_frequency_mhz"`.
   * The `cpu_freq.max if cpu_freq else None` logic is defensive programming in case the system can’t report its frequency.

3. **Function `def get_ram_info():`**

   * Similar to CPU, but collects RAM stats.
   * `ram = psutil.virtual_memory()` gets memory details.
   * The return line converts from bytes to GB (dividing by `1024 ** 3`) and rounds values to 2 decimal places.
   * Returns a dictionary like `{ "total": 16.0, "used": 8.5, "free": 7.5 }`.

4. **If block:**

   * `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures that the print commands only run if this script is executed directly.
   * Calls `get_cpu_info()` and `get_ram_info()` and prints results.

## Questions I have:

* How deep does `psutil` go on firmware-level data?
* Can we reliably extract BIOS/UEFI versions this way, or do we need another tool?

## Next steps:

* Build out `validate.py` to compare collected data against YAML rules
* Explore how to handle edge cases (missing or partial system info)
* Consider adding disk or firmware info if time permits
